# About the SIMCODES Organization

Our overall goal is to provide undergraduate students with new research
experiences in the multidisciplinary fields of computational chemistry,
biochemistry, and computer science to develop software, simulation, and
analysis techniques to predict next generation enzymatic catalysts. Of
particular note, the Sustainability Institute for Machine learning and
Collaborative Open-source Development of Enzymatic Simulations (SIMCODES) REU
program at Iowa State University (ISU) seeks to recruit highly diverse cohorts
of very early career undergraduates from underrepresented communities through
networking with community colleges, primarily undergraduate serving
institutions, and ISU programs.

The cross-disciplinary nature of the project is a strength that will provide
students with a unique perspective on the development and use of computational
best practices (software engineering and model correctness) with the rapidly
evolving landscape of artificial intelligence in the context of the important
biochemical application of determining enzymatic catalytic behavior. Student
participants will additionally benefit from experienced mentorship and formal
training in interdisciplinary research and professional development. We expect
to increase the number of students with diverse backgrounds and limited
research exposure who continue into STEM degree programs.
