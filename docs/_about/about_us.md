# About the SIMCODES Organization

Our overall goal is to provide undergraduate students with new research experiences 
in the multidisciplinary fields of computational chemistry, biochemistry, and computer science to develop
software, simulation, and analysis techniques to predict next generation enzymatic catalysts. Of
particular note, the Sustainability Institute for Machine learning and Collaborative Open-source
Development of Enzymatic Simulations (SIMCODES) REU program at Iowa State University (ISU)
seeks to recruit highly diverse cohorts of very early career undergraduates from underrepresented
communities through networking with community colleges, primarily undergraduate serving institutions,
and ISU programs.
 
The cross-disciplinary nature of the project is a strength that will
provide students with a unique perspective on the development and use of computational best
practices (software engineering and model correctness) with the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial
intelligence in the context of the important biochemical application of determining enzymatic
catalytic behavior. Student participants will additionally benefit from experienced mentorship and
formal training in interdisciplinary research and professional development. We expect to increase
the number of students with diverse backgrounds and limited research exposure who continue into
STEM degree programs.
