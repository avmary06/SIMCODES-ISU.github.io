# Example Research Projects

Our research interest focuses on the application and development of theoretical and computational tools for the study of chemical reactions in chemical and biochemical systems. Currently, we are developing theories of electron transfer in solutions and inhomogeneous materials, solvent effects on chemical reactions in condensed phases, solvation dynamics in protein environments, phase behaviors and nucleation kinetics of metallic systems and theory of protein solutions, sub-diffraction imaging using heterodyne and entangled photons.

Some of the research project in the group is:
Solvation dynamics in ionic fluids and an extended Debye-HÃ¼ckel theory,
Phase behaviors and nucleation kinetics of protein solutions
Sub-diffraction imaging using heterodyne and entangled photons
Studies of nano-domains of supercooled liquids using machine learning
